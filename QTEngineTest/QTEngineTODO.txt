Testing TODO
- DFR toggle (Projections and highlight)
- Better Asset Selector (already have helper file)
- Add toggle for "Display Parent Cycle Opens" (Maybe a list: All Opens, Q1 + Q2, None)
- Help with SSMT drawings (if PQH get swept in the first 1/3 of the Quarter, only draw the SSMT line to extend to the 1/3 of the Quarter. If it later retrades above PQH in the 2/3 then redraw the line to extend 2/3 of the Quarter. Same for if it retrades above PQH during the 3/3, the extend the drawing to the end of the Quarter)
