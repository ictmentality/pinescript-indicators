QTEngine TODO

- Weekly Cycle functionality (OHLC) 
- Monthly Cycle functionality 
- Quarterly Cycle functionality
- Yearly Cycle functionality
- Quandrennial Cycle functionality

- Forex Time Handling (Maybe we already handle these, need to confirm and test)

QTEngine Modules (Should these be modules or should my indicator's implement them by themselves. Library vs Indicator function)
- SSMT
- HSSMT
- tCISD
- 1st P FVG after SSMT
- PSP/TPD





Testing TODO
- DFR toggle (Projections and highlight)
- Better Asset Selector (already have helper file)
- Add toggle for "Display Parent Cycle Opens" (Maybe a list: All Opens, Q1 + Q2, None)
- Help with SSMT drawings
