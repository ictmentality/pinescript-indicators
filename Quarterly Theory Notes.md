Quarterly Theory Notes

**DAYE VIDEO NOTES**

DAYE — SUNDAY NOTES CHEAT SHEET (FOMC WEEK / CALENDAR + SEQUENTIAL SMT)
======================================================================

GOAL
----
Use TIME (economic calendar) + Sequential SMT to anticipate where/when the
weekly high/low forms. Going forward: focus Weekly + Monthly cycles (not
just 90m).


1) ECONOMIC CALENDAR = TIME MODEL (NOT NEWS MEANING)
---------------------------------------------------
- Red folder (high impact) days/time windows = when explosive price action is
  most likely.
- You do NOT need to know what the news means; treat it as a timing schedule.
- Monday/Tuesday with no red folder:
  - does NOT mean "free trades"
  - can mean lower probability unless the model aligns


2) WEEKLY LOW/HIGH EXPECTATIONS (FROM RED-FOLDER CLUSTERING)
------------------------------------------------------------
If the week has major red-folder clustering (ex: Wed/Thu/Fri):
- Expect the Low of Week to form most often on:
  - Wednesday OR Thursday (not guaranteed)

Important: In a triad (NQ / ES / YM), LOW of week usually won’t print on the
same day for all 3 if Sequential SMT is present:
- one may form LOW on Wednesday
- another may form LOW on Thursday


3) BEST TRADE WINDOWS (WHEN CONDITIONS ARE MET)
----------------------------------------------
He calls out these as best windows *if* Sequential SMT is present:
- Wednesday: afternoon session
- Thursday: morning session
- Friday: morning session


4) "HIGH-PROBABILITY" SEQUENTIAL SMT FILTER (NEWS-TIME ALIGNMENT)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Sequential SMT is highest probability when it occurs:
- at the exact time of the high-impact release, OR
- 30 to 60 minutes after the release,
AND it happens inside the same QUARTER that contains the release.

Rule form:
- SMT in the news-quarter window => higher probability
- SMT outside the window => lower probability (de-emphasize)


5) SMT FAMILY SEQUENCING (STACKING ACROSS TIMEFRAMES)
-----------------------------------------------------
He describes a repeatable sequence:
1) Higher-timeframe SMT
2) Medium-timeframe SMT
3) Lower-timeframe SMT

Use-case:
- Don’t press size on a single SMT.
- Prefer stacked SMT progression (HTF -> mid -> LTF).


6) "FAKE THEN REAL" SEQUENTIAL SMT (ENTRY DISCIPLINE)
-----------------------------------------------------
Key claim:
- Often the first sequential SMT is "fake" (setup formation),
  then the "real" one comes after.

Operational rule:
- Do NOT short the first break above a prior quarter level just because SMT
  appeared.
- Wait for the next step: the post-event swing forms, THEN gets run.

7) WHERE "REAL LIQUIDITY" TENDS TO BE (POST-SMT SWING HIGH)
-----------------------------------------------------------
He claims the strongest liquidity is:
- ABOVE a swing high (true swing definition: middle candle higher than both sides)

Important rule:
- After the first SMT-triggering breach of a prior quarter high,
  the FIRST swing high that forms after that event is a key reference.
- Expect that post-event swing high to be breached (run) before the true move.


8) WHAT TO CARE ABOUT ON CHART (PRIMITIVES)
-------------------------------------------
Priority:
- Highs + Lows
- Gaps / Imbalances (FVGs)

De-emphasize:
- Order blocks / breakers unless they are supported by imbalances


9) DISPLACEMENT CONFIRMATION (INDEX REGIME SHIFT)
-------------------------------------------------
- One index displacing is not enough.
- For strong confirmation, he wants all three (ex: NQ/ES/YM) to show displacement.
- If you only see "sequentiality of lows" without clean displacement alignment,
  expect more consolidation.


10) SUNDAY STUDY CHECKLIST (WHAT TO DO EACH WEEK)
-------------------------------------------------
A) Calendar scan:
   - mark red-folder days + exact release times
B) Choose your correlated set (triad/pair):
   - indices (NQ/ES/YM) or FX pairs or BTC/ETH
C) Plan the window:
   - focus Wed/Thu if the red-folder cluster is there
D) Execution filter:
   - look for Sequential SMT at release or 30–60m after (in that quarter)
E) Patience rule:
   - assume "fake then real" SMT; wait for post-event swing formation + run
F) Trade direction:
   - trade in the direction implied by the Sequential SMT / SMT stack


ONE-LINE SUMMARY
----------------
Calendar gives the "WHEN"; Sequential SMT (stacked HTF->LTF) gives the "WHERE";
avoid the first ("fake") SMT and focus the post-event swing + timed run.



DAYE — WEEKLY ANALYSIS NOTES (ECON CALENDAR + INTERMARKET SMT + UTC+2 TIME MODEL)
===============================================================================

WHAT THIS TALK IS ABOUT
-----------------------
- Weekly planning starts with the economic calendar (red folders).
- Use Intermarket Sequential SMT + "True Opens" to time reversals.
- Key new emphasis: the algorithm’s "operating time" is framed as UTC+2 (Switzerland),
  and the 4 x 6-hour session structure maps cleanly to Daily quarters.

(He also opens with admin notes about migrating/community tooling; not trading-relevant.)


1) START WITH THE ECONOMIC CALENDAR (TIME WINDOWS)
-------------------------------------------------
- Red-folder windows = when price is most likely to manipulate or expand.
- USD red folders are prioritized because USD is "connected to everything".
- If your chosen triad shows no movement/correlation, look elsewhere (intermarket).

This week’s read (from calendar alone):
- Expect more movement in GBP because:
  - USD news + GBP news (while EUR news is absent) => more flow / volatility into GBP.
- He explicitly says: "we don't trade the Euro" (his group bias/preference).


2) SEQUENTIAL SMT EXPECTATIONS FROM CALENDAR STRUCTURE
------------------------------------------------------
He uses the calendar to pre-plan:
- Watch Friday’s high/low (as reference levels) going into Monday/Tuesday.
- If sequential SMT forms between "last week -> Monday", expect reversal on Tuesday.
- If similar conditions persist "Tuesday -> Monday", expect reversal (again).

Timing note:
- London news at ~2:00am ET is treated as a key "London makes HOD/LOD" window.
- He anticipates the Asian session response even before Monday arrives (time-first planning).


3) "QUARTERS LINING UP" = HIGH PROBABILITY SETUPS (NESTED QUARTERS)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- When quarters from different cycles align (example language: "Q3 within Q3"),
  and correlation is present, setup probability increases.
- He flags this as a major confluence concept to be expanded later.


4) INTERMARKET SMT: FX TRIAD + INTEREST RATE TRIAD (2-STAGE CONFIRMATION)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Triads mentioned:
- FX triad: USD, EUR, GBP (but he focuses mainly on EUR+GBP relationship)
- Rates triad: T-Bond / 10Y / 5Y (interest rate complex)

Key claim:
- Explosive moves often appear when you get "two stages":
  1) Higher-timeframe intermarket sequential SMT (monthly context)
  2) Lower-timeframe intermarket sequential SMT (weekly / intraday context)

He stresses:
- You don’t need to watch USD constantly if EUR/GBP relationship is clear,
  but USD can help as context.
- They focus on highs/lows and closures; no need for OBs/breakers here.


5) TRUE OPEN + SEQUENTIAL SMT ABOVE TRUE OPEN = "PERFECT CONDITION"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On 4H (used for Monthly-cycle context):
- He draws and references the True Open of the month for GBP and EUR.
- Core behavior repeated:
  - Expect sequential SMT ABOVE True Open => reversal / downside continuation setup.
  - Closures matter (wicks alone are lower significance).

He shows a common pattern:
- Trade above True Open -> breakdown on Tuesday
- Wednesday spike up -> then fall
(He frames this as consistent with their model.)


6) "CANCEL RULE": BIGGER-RANGE SMT OVERRIDES SMALLER-RANGE SMT
--------------------------------------------------------------
Important rule statement (paraphrased):
- A smaller/local sequential SMT signal should be ignored if a larger-range SMT
  is already underway and in control.
- Example: people misread a USD move as sequential SMT, but it was invalid
  because the higher-timeframe sequence was already in progress.

Extra filter:
- Weekly TF: a wick without a close above is not enough.
- If it opposes the HTF cycle order flow, treat it as MSS / correlation crack,
  not a true reversal trigger.


7) "CRACKING CORRELATION" (ASYMMETRY IS INFORMATION)
----------------------------------------------------
He repeatedly frames asymmetry as the signal:
- If one market does the key action and another doesn’t,
  that itself is information (a correlation crack).
Examples he highlights:
- One asset trades beyond a True Open while another fails to.
- One asset hits a gap/BPR area while another does not.

Rule of thumb:
- Price symmetry across USD/EUR/GBP => look to Interest Rate triad for the "why".


8) RANGE MANAGEMENT: ONLY HIGH / LOW MATTERS
--------------------------------------------
He simplifies execution in ranges:
- Identify the range high and range low (liquidity pools).
- Ignore the "middle" noise; OBs in the middle of ranges are low value.
- Do nothing without Sequential SMT.

Practical framing:
- If price breaks below the range low AND sequential SMT forms -> expect reversal higher.
- If price breaks above the range high AND sequential SMT forms -> expect reversal lower.
- Avoid initiating during Asian session (he calls that a "no-go").


9) CORE PROCESS RULE (VERY SPECIFIC)
------------------------------------
- Enter on Sequential SMT.
- Exit on SMT.
(Exit can be on any SMT type; the point is you exit when SMT appears against your position.)

He claims the root cause of reversals boils down to:
- Failure swings + stop hunts
(in the context of SMT/time.)


10) BIG NEW CLAIM: UTC+2 (SWITZERLAND) IS "ALGO TIME"
-----------------------------------------------------
He argues the "actual time" the algorithm is pegged to is UTC+2 (Switzerland),
not EST (he suggests EST teaching is misleading).

Session mapping in UTC+2 (6-hour blocks):
- 00:00–06:00  = Asia
- 06:00–12:00  = London
- 12:00–18:00  = New York
- 18:00–24:00  = "Afternoon" / late session

Daily structure:
- 4 candles x 6 hours = 1 daily cycle (clean quarterly mapping)

True Week Open (as described here):
- Tuesday 00:00 (UTC+2) is framed as the "actual True Open of the week".
- He shows a case where price traded above it (stop-hunt) + intermarket SMT,
  then sold off (as confirmation of the framework).


11) STUDY CHECKLIST (WHAT TO DO WITH THIS)
------------------------------------------
A) Calendar scan:
   - Mark USD and GBP red folders; treat them as time windows for expansion/manipulation.
B) Pick the clearer driver:
   - If GBP has more scheduled catalysts than USD and EUR is quiet, prioritize GBP.
C) Work top-down in triads:
   - FX triad first; if symmetrical, consult the Interest Rate triad for confirmation.
D) Require closures:
   - Treat closes beyond key levels (True Opens / range extremes) as higher quality than wicks.
E) Trade plan:
   - Define weekly range high/low and Friday’s low/high.
   - Wait for Sequential SMT at the boundary (do nothing without it).
F) Time model test:
   - Flip chart to UTC+2 and annotate the 6-hour quarters; track if your SMT/reversals
     cluster around those quarter boundaries and session opens.


ONE-LINE SUMMARY
----------------
Calendar tells WHEN; intermarket sequential SMT + true opens tell WHERE; UTC+2 6-hour quarters
are the proposed "al algo clock" that makes the session/quarter puzzle fit.


DAYE — LAST 30 DAYS REVIEW (CPI WEEK) + HTF SEQ SMT + "GEAR SHIFT" RULES
======================================================================

WHAT THIS TALK IS ABOUT
-----------------------
- Review the last ~30 days of price action across FX triad (USD/EUR/GBP) + index futures.
- Anchor analysis to: (1) econ calendar liquidity injections, (2) higher-timeframe Sequential SMT,
  (3) closures > wicks, (4) premium/discount defined by the *active* HTF sequence.
- CPI direction is framed as *not random* when HTF sequential SMT is established.


1) START WITH LIQUIDITY INJECTION WINDOWS (ECON CALENDAR)
---------------------------------------------------------
- He frames "major time points" as when liquidity gets injected: red-folder clusters.
- Example read:
  - Wednesday: multiple high-impact events (4 folders referenced).
  - Thursday: "most news" => expected most volatility.
  - Friday: only one major USD event => less volatility expected.

Core idea:
- Use news clusters to anticipate expansion/manipulation windows, then apply SMT logic at those times.


2) WHY THE LAST 30 DAYS TRENDED DOWN (HTF CYCLE CONTROLS)
---------------------------------------------------------
Claim:
- Bullish sequential SMT signals on LTFs "didn’t hold" because the *higher-timeframe cycle*
  was bearish for the foreign currencies (focus: EUR & GBP vs USD).

Primary HTF reference he uses:
- Yearly-quarter sequential SMT: Q4 2023 highs vs Q1 2024 behavior.
- GBP traded above the key Q4 high while EUR failed to reach comparable highs
  => sequential SMT (yearly-quarter context) that biases continuation until a larger/equal counter-signal appears.


3) "QUALITY" FILTERS: CLOSURES + RANGE DEPTH (NOT SHALLOW)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Closures matter more than wicks.
- He repeatedly rejects "shallow" moves as not qualifying for meaningful sequential SMT.
- Prefers:
  - Close above the high (not just wick)
  - "Beefy" candle (body acceptance)
  - Ideally >50% of candle body above the reference level


4) STAGE MODEL: SMT → SEQUENTIAL SMT (2-STAGE PROGRESSION)
----------------------------------------------------------
He describes a common progression:
- Stage 1: regular SMT prints (asymmetry shows up)
- Stage 2: sequential SMT prints *after* SMT, which can shift/confirm order flow

He also uses language like:
- "Stage one / stage two" rather than "double sequential SMT".


5) PRECISION SWING POINT (PSP) → HIGH-PROBABILITY ORDER BLOCK
-------------------------------------------------------------
Definition (as described in talk):
- A PSP forms on a specific candle (he highlights a particular daily candle).
- Once price closes below the PSP (after a run above / SMT context), that candle becomes a
  "high-probability order block" (his framing: “master class OB”).

Operational note:
- He implies you do NOT short simply because an SMT printed.
- You wait for sequential SMT *above* the SMT and a PSP/close structure that confirms.


6) PREMIUM / DISCOUNT IS FLEXIBLE (DEFINED BY ACTIVE HTF RANGE)
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Premium/discount should be graded from an “extreme low” to the relevant swing high,
  but he stresses it’s contextual:
  - One market can be in extreme premium while another is not (triad comparison).
- He uses:
  - Dotted gray line for extreme low reference
  - Red line for the low that got ran / caused a failure swing

Key warning:
- Don’t anchor premium/discount off an outdated range if a higher-order sequence has shifted.


7) "GEAR SHIFT" RULE: ONE TRIAD MEMBER CAN RESET THE WHOLE MAP
--------------------------------------------------------------
Core claim:
- When one member of the triad (often GBP in his examples) consolidates / sets the clearest structure,
  it can determine the correct premium/discount + future order flow.

He states explicitly:
- “Everything before here became irrelevant” once GBP closed above the two key highs
  (especially the time-based high that completed the higher-order sequential SMT).

Practical implication:
- If you grade premium/discount from the “wrong” anchor (e.g., EUR range that was superseded),
  you’ll get trapped holding the wrong bias.


8) CPI: "NOT RANDOM" WHEN SEQ SMT IS ESTABLISHED
------------------------------------------------
Claim:
- CPI direction is strongly inferable once sequential SMT is established (he rejects 50/50 framing).

Process rule around CPI:
- The day before CPI: wait (don’t force trades).
- ~15 minutes before CPI: plan only if structure is already established.
- He cites a common pattern:
  - Wicks can manipulate, but closures show the real sequence.
  - After CPI, price often runs “gone never to return” in the direction of the established SMT.


9) WEEKLY + MONTHLY ALIGNMENT (INTERMARKET SEQ SMT)
---------------------------------------------------
He references:
- Intermarket sequential SMT between:
  - FX triads (their selected ones)
  - Interest rate triad (IRT)
as reinforcing bias even when people “had no bearish thoughts.”

General point:
- Multi-cycle confirmation (monthly + weekly) increases conviction for continuation moves.


10) CPI DAY H/L + ENTRY/EXIT RULES (EXECUTION SIMPLIFICATION)
-------------------------------------------------------------
He repeats a very specific execution rule-set:

- Enter on Sequential SMT.
- Exit on Sequential SMT (or SMT) at opposing/target liquidity.
  (He says: "enter where you have sequential SMT, exit where you have sequential SMT.")

Two entry styles he allows (both must be justified by seq SMT):
1) Internal liquidity entry in discount (within range)
2) Failure swing entry:
   - Buy below a low / sell above a high when sequential SMT supports it

He also emphasizes:
- CPI day high/low are important references in the following sessions.


11) INDEX FUTURES EXAMPLE: NWOG + FAILURE SWING + SEQ SMT CONFLUENCE
-------------------------------------------------------------------
He references a confluence cluster:
- New Week Opening Gap (NWOG) reaction
- Failure swing forming into NWOG
- Sequential SMT while above/below key highs

He frames it as “very high probability” when:
- One index closes above a key high while another is reacting into NWOG,
  and sequential SMT is present across the pair.


12) TRADE TIMING GUIDANCE (WHAT NOT TO DO)
------------------------------------------
- Don’t try to “find something” late Friday afternoon (he explicitly discourages it).
- Best days: Monday–Thursday.
- Best day (his opinion): Thursday
  - “Designed for reversals” (peak manipulation in weekly cycle framing)

Q1 note:
- Q1 (as a quarter context) can be lower probability because expansion may not return to fill gaps;
  more chop / runaway moves (harder to manage).


STUDY CHECKLIST (WHAT TO DO WITH THIS)
--------------------------------------
A) Mark news clusters (CPI week especially); treat them as timing windows.
B) Identify HTF sequential SMT (yearly/monthly/weekly) BEFORE trusting LTF signals.
C) Use closures > wicks for qualification.
D) Validate "gear shift" moments: when a clearer triad member defines the new range.
E) Grade premium/discount from the active HTF anchor (not stale levels).
F) Execution discipline:
   - Only act on sequential SMT.
   - Use SMT/sequential SMT for exits (don’t over-hold against the HTF bias).
G) Avoid low-quality timing (late Friday); prioritize Mon–Thu, especially Thu for reversals.


ONE-LINE SUMMARY
----------------
News tells WHEN liquidity hits; higher-order sequential SMT tells WHICH direction wins; closures confirm the shift;
once the triad “gear shifts,” old ranges are dead—trade only the new premium/discount map.



DAYE — CPI WEEK: "DISPERSAL OF LIQUIDITY" + INTERMARKET SEQ SMT + 2 TRUE-OPEN RULE
===============================================================================

WHAT THIS ONE ADDS VS PRIOR TALKS
---------------------------------
- Introduces “dispersal of liquidity” across a triad (unequal liquidity allocation -> one market expands more).
- Reframes CPI week moves as: weekly-cycle intermarket sequential SMT + news injection + true-open stacking.
- Adds a hard filter: if USD and the Interest Rate Triad move in the same direction, *don’t trade* (low probability).

0) CONTEXT / RECAP
------------------
- Monday & Tuesday: framed as low probability.
- Wednesday: CPI day (big manipulation / liquidity injection).
- CPI day (usually in week 2 of the month) “sets the trend for the week.”
- CPI itself = manipulation + inducement; the follow-through day confirms direction.

Key CPI liquidity rule:
- CPI-day high and low become major liquidity pools.
- If price is near CPI-day low -> “enormous liquidity below.”
- If price is near CPI/previous-day high -> “a lot of liquidity above.”

1) MINIMAL "ONE SHOT ONE KILL" TOOLKIT
--------------------------------------
Claim:
- You don’t need HTF PD arrays for the cleanest “one shot one kill.”
- You only need:
  - Premium/Discount
  - Sequential SMT
  - Gap (FVG / gap concept)

2) “ANOTHER TYPE OF CRACKING CORRELATION”
-----------------------------------------
- Not the typical “SMT fill” concept.
- For each market group, one instrument tends to “control everything”:
  - Index futures triad: often Dow
  - Forex: he implies “GU” (GBPUSD) as a driver
  - Interest rate triad: often the 5Y note

3) WEEKLY CYCLE + FRACTALITY (WHY HE TEACHES WEEKLY FIRST)
----------------------------------------------------------
- Weekly cycle is the “basis” for day trades and “one shot one kill.”
- Everything is fractal: weekly patterns repeat in daily, 90m, micro, yearly, etc.
- Weekly trading fits:
  - Traders with less screen time or more patience
  - People who want high-probability directional order flow

4) INTEREST RATE TRIAD LOOKED SYMMETRICAL… BUT FX DIDN’T
--------------------------------------------------------
Setup described (weekly-cycle context, 1H chart):
- Interest rate triad printed repeated higher highs (Wed > Tue high multiple times).
- Within the IR triad itself: appeared symmetrical (no internal “cracking correlation”).
- But vs FX:
  - IR triad made the higher high (strength)
  - EU/GU printed lower highs (relative weakness)
=> This mismatch is labeled:
- “Intermarket sequential SMT” (across triads), which preceded the turn lower.

Practical note:
- Even without “lipstick” indicators, he wants you to see this on a clean chart.

5) ENTRY LOGIC HE SUGGESTS FOR THAT TURN
----------------------------------------
- Because the IR triad made a higher high while EU/GU did not, he treats it as enough to:
  - Enter from a FVG / rejection block region
  - Stop above the swing reference (he implies it’s structurally safe even without drilling to lower TF)

6) WHY PRICE GRAVITATED AFTER THE TURN
--------------------------------------
- After the turn, he points to “symmetrical lows” (equal-ish lows / relative equal lows),
  not caused by SMT, acting as magnets.
- Expectation:
  - EU/GU to gravitate toward those lows
  - DXY toward its corresponding highs (liquidity objectives)

7) CPI DIRECTION: “NOT RANDOM”
------------------------------
Claim:
- CPI direction is not a random coin flip.
- It tends to align with *weekly-cycle sequential SMT* / intermarket sequential SMT context.
- “Market makers aren’t pressing a random button.”

8) WHEN TO OPEN THE INTEREST RATE TRIAD TAB
-------------------------------------------
Rule:
- If you already have sequential SMT *inside* your primary triad (FX triad or index triad),
  you don’t need the IR triad—price action confirms it.

But:
- If you see “nothing here” (no clear sequential SMT) and price action is “in sync” / unclear,
  you check the IR triad to find intermarket sequential SMT.

Mechanistic framing:
- USD acts as the “bridge” linking FX to bonds.
- Algo “searches for information” across triads when the primary view looks symmetrical.

9) HARD FILTER: USD + IR TRIAD SAME DIRECTION = DO NOTHING
----------------------------------------------------------
He states explicitly:
- If DXY and the interest rate triad are moving in the same direction:
  - Low probability
  - Expect consolidation / messy swings / “no gaps being filled”
  - “High resistance liquidity runs” (ICT phrasing referenced)

10) WEEKLY HIGH/LOW OF WEEK: WED/THU BIAS (NOT ICT 70% RULE)
------------------------------------------------------------
He rejects ICT’s “70% of time DOW forms weekly H/L” claim.
His bias:
- Weekly H/L is more likely on Wednesday and Thursday,
  especially when:
  - Little/no news Mon/Tue
  - News concentrated Wed/Thu (and sometimes Fri)

11) TRUE-OPEN STACKING RULE (NEW/IMPORTANT)
-------------------------------------------
He introduces a “2 true opens” requirement:
- To have readable order flow / determined direction:
  - Price should be trading below at least TWO true opens (not one)
  - Example: below True Week Open + below True Day Open

He parallels it to a “2 sequential SMTs” framing:
- Not “one-off”—needs stacking/confirmation (his wording is messy but intent is: multi-confirmation increases clarity).

12) “DISPERSAL OF LIQUIDITY” (UNEQUAL ALLOCATION ACROSS TRIAD)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Core concept:
- Liquidity is not always “equally dispersed” across the three.
- One market can receive most of the expansion energy.
- He uses a rough allocation example:
  - NQ gets ~55–60% of the move
  - ES gets some remainder
  - YM gets least (e.g., 15%)

Implication:
- The “weaker” leg (often Dow/YM) may take lows more aggressively.
- The “stronger” leg (often NQ) may expand the most and be the better trading vehicle.

13) EXAMPLE HE WALKS: INDEX TRIAD SMT + GAP CONTEXT
---------------------------------------------------
Observed structure (his narrative):
- Dow takes a low while NQ is trading into a gap (close sitting inside the gap).
- That creates SMT.
- When you get:
  - Higher-timeframe SMT
  - Then lower-timeframe SMT after
=> The two “stronger” legs (ES/NQ) are expected to expand more vs the weaker leg (YM).

He emphasizes:
- “We don’t really trade the Dow” (use it as the tell; trade ES/NQ).

14) MONTHLY CYCLE CHECK (4H as monthly lens)
-------------------------------------------
He flips to 4H for monthly-cycle context and notes:
- Prior week low reference
- Dow still below that low (needs “catch up”)
- NQ had equal highs above (magnet)
- Sequential SMT exists on monthly (Q1→Q2) + then again inside the week (Tue→Thu)
=> That multi-cycle alignment explains why NQ expanded and took previous-day highs.

15) NEWS INJECTION IS REQUIRED (SEQ SMT + EVENT)
------------------------------------------------
He adds a constraint:
- Sequential SMT alone isn’t enough.
- You need a scheduled liquidity injection (news event) behind it.
- These events are scheduled far in advance; price action repeats (fractal).

CLOSING TAKEAWAYS (THE RULESET AS PRESENTED)
--------------------------------------------
- CPI week:
  - CPI day = manipulation + inducement; CPI high/low become major liquidity pools.
  - Follow-through day often confirms weekly direction.
- Trade selection:
  - Use YM as the tell; trade ES/NQ (often NQ expands most).
- Structure filters:
  - Closures matter more than wicks.
  - Prefer sequential SMT + gap context.
- Confirmation:
  - Multi-triad intermarket sequential SMT can trigger reversals even if a single triad looks “symmetrical.”
- Avoid:
  - When DXY and IR triad move together: stand down (expect messy conditions).
- Direction clarity:
  - Better when price is below (or above) TWO true opens (stacked true-open condition).
