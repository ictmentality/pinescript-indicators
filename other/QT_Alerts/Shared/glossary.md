- Daily cycle: top-level “story scope” filter.
- H4 cycle quarter: C1..C4 classification on 240m.
- Micro cycle: Q1..Q4 on the micro schedule (from QTEngine).
- SSMT: Sequential SMT between quarters (e.g., Q3→Q4) across correlated assets.
- FVG: ICT fair value gap (3-candle displacement gap).
- SMT-F (SMT-Fill): divergence in how correlated assets retrace/fill a same-time FVG.
- tCISD: Micro tCISD level (from QTEngine). Entry validation requires a close beyond it.
